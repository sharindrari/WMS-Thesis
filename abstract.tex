In this thesis, we design and partly develop a Workflow Management System (WMS) aimed to work on top of Stratosphere, a Big Data platform developed by TU Berlin. The WMS is defined by means of a Domain Specific Language (DSL) written in Scala. Control Flow and data dependencies are automatically detected by static analysis on the Scala code through the following three stages: (1) create a Control Flow Graph as an intermediate representation from Scala AST, (2) detect data dependencies in the graph, and (3) generate code for the underlying system. We cover the implementation of the first stage and provide the algorithm for the subsequent two stages. In the evaluation, we argue over the advantages of this DSL compared to related WMS work in terms of user-friendliness and independence of underlying platform.
